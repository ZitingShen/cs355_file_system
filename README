Disk Format:
************************
boot block
************************
superblock
************************
inode region
************************
data region
(including free blocks)
************************
reserved region to
store free block indices
************************
swap region
************************

Limitations:
1. Format will set the initial data_offset to 1% of the disk image size to leave some space for the inode region to grow. If the inode region grows larger than the given size, an error will be returned.

2. The disk can have at most 4294967295 files, and each file has at most 12 characters name.



Todos:
1. Check permission for all disk operations.

2. Valgrind all the tests.
